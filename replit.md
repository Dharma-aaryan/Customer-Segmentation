# ML Project Dashboard

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Machine Learning Dashboard built with Streamlit that provides an interactive interface for ML project analysis, visualization, and predictions. The application serves as a centralized platform for data scientists and ML practitioners to upload datasets, analyze model performance, make predictions, and examine Jupyter notebooks. The dashboard supports multiple file formats and provides detailed insights through interactive visualizations and metrics.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit-based web application with a multi-page navigation structure
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for navigation between different functional sections
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state for persisting datasets, models, and notebooks across page navigation
- **UI Components**: Modular page structure with five main sections: File Upload, Data Exploration, Model Performance, Predictions, and Notebook Analysis

### Backend Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Utils-based architecture with separate classes for distinct functionalities
- **Core Components**:
